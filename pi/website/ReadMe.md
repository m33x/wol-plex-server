# Website

Please change the following files:

```
js -> custom -> main.js
api -> get_state.php
api -> wakeup.php
```

You need to enter your own URLs and authentication credentials there.

You will also need to download the [wakeonlan Perl script](https://github.com/jpoliv/wakeonlan/blob/master/wakeonlan).
Move it to the `api` folder and make it executable (`chmod +x wakeonlan`).
